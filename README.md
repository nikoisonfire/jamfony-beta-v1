# Jamfony MVP 

_My bachelor thesis project. Working on a different v2 so I thought "Why the hell not. I'll release the source code"_

_Obviously this is far from complete, but in my defense I had 3 months to build the prototype and write the 40 page thesis ðŸ˜¬._

_If you have any questions, hit me up on twitter_
